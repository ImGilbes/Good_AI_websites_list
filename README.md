# Good_AI_websites_list: just a list of good AI websites
---
## Research
[ChatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/) Summary of PDF files, can be used for papers. You can also ask questions. There are slightly better sites out there that do the same thing, but they make you subscribe. This one does the job

[Phind](https://www.phind.com/) ChatGPT but better, includes references to the websites/resources it uses

[Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) Same as Phind, but sometimes summarizes too much. I usually use both.
